# Introduction

Welcome to **LSMTPD** â€” a lightweight and high-performance SMTP server designed to bridge email and message queues.  

---

## What is LSMTPD?

**LSMTPD** stands for **Lightweight SMTP Daemon**.  
It is a minimalistic SMTP server that accepts incoming email messages and forwards them directly into **AMQP** (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) systems.  

In practice, this means that instead of having to run a full traditional mail server stack (which can be complex, heavy, and hard to configure), you can deploy LSMTPD to **receive mail over SMTP and deliver it straight into your existing message queue**.  

This makes it extremely useful for applications that:  
- Need to process incoming emails as events.  
- Require email integration inside distributed systems or microservices.  
- Want a clean and reliable way to move email data into message-driven workflows.

## Why does LSMTPD exist?

Traditional mail transfer agents (MTAs) like Postfix or Exim are extremely powerful and flexible, but they are also:  
- Heavy and complex to configure.  
- Designed for full mail delivery and relay, not lightweight forwarding.  
- Overkill when all you need is *"receive an email and push it into a queue."*  

**LSMTPD was created to solve exactly that problem.**  
It focuses on a **single responsibility**: acting as a **bridge between SMTP and AMQP**, without unnecessary features or overhead.  

By narrowing its scope, LSMTPD can offer:  
- A **simpler configuration** compared to traditional MTAs.  
- **Lower resource usage**, making it suitable for containerized or serverless environments.  
- **More predictable behavior**, since it is purpose-built for one job.

## Why use LSMTPD?

There are several reasons why LSMTPD stands out as a solution for modern systems:

### 1. Lightweight and Efficient
LSMTPD has been designed to be minimal. It doesnâ€™t attempt to replicate a full mail server stack â€” it does one thing, and does it well: **receive mail and forward to AMQP.**  
This makes it ideal for microservices, event-driven systems, and cloud-native deployments where efficiency and simplicity matter.

### 2. Seamless AMQP Integration
Because it directly integrates with **AMQP**, LSMTPD allows you to plug email data into your existing messaging infrastructure.  
That means you can process emails the same way you handle other events, jobs, or messages â€” with the same queues, consumers, and workflows you already rely on.

### 3. Reliability and Safety
Built in **Rust**, LSMTPD benefits from Rustâ€™s guarantees around memory safety and concurrency.  
This makes the server robust, secure, and performant under load. It is designed with production use in mind and can handle real-world email traffic reliably.

### 4. Open Source and Transparent
LSMTPD is fully open source and licensed under **GPL-3.0**.  
This ensures that you:  
- Have full access to the source code.  
- Can audit it for security and reliability.  
- Are free to extend or contribute improvements back to the project.

## When should you use LSMTPD?

LSMTPD is the right tool for you if:  
- You need to **capture incoming emails** and feed them into an event-driven system.  
- Youâ€™re building **automation workflows** that respond to email messages.  
- You want a **simple, minimal alternative** to a full mail server.  
- Youâ€™re working with **AMQP-based systems** and want a direct email â†’ queue pipeline.  

If you need advanced mail features (mail storage, spam filtering, outbound relay, virtual domains, etc.), then a traditional MTA is a better choice. But if your goal is *just to forward incoming emails into a queue*, LSMTPD is designed for that exact purpose.

## Summary

**LSMTPD** is a purpose-built, open source SMTP server that:  
- Accepts emails over SMTP.  
- Forwards them directly into AMQP queues.  
- Is fast, minimal, and reliable thanks to Rust.  
- Provides a simple way to integrate email into modern distributed systems.  

It strips away the complexity of traditional mail servers, leaving you with a clean and efficient solution for email-to-message-queue pipelines.
