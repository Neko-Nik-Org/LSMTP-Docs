Great question 👍 Since you’ve got a solid **Intro** page already, the next step is to build out a clear **docs structure** so users can quickly understand, install, configure, and use LSMTPD.

Here’s a recommended structure for your docs (modeled after successful open source projects):

---

## 📚 Suggested Docs Structure

### 1. **Introduction** ✅ (done)

Explains what LSMTPD is, why it exists, and when to use it.

---

### 2. **Getting Started**

* Quickstart example (install → run → receive mail → see it in AMQP).
* Minimal working config.
* Short demo (even just text).

---

### 3. **Installation**

* Debian/Ubuntu (with your apt repo instructions).
* Docker / container usage.
* Building from source (Rust cargo instructions).

---

### 4. **Configuration**

* Config file format (or env vars, if you support them).
* Explanation of main options (SMTP listen address, AMQP connection, logging, etc).
* Example configs (basic, production, cloud).

---

### 5. **How It Works**

* Lifecycle of an email through LSMTPD.
* SMTP → Parsing → AMQP publish → Consumer.
* Optional diagram (SMTP client → LSMTPD → AMQP broker → Your app).

---

### 6. **Use Cases & Examples**

* Ingesting emails into a queue for processing.
* Hooking into spam filters or downstream workers.
* Using with RabbitMQ / Qpid / Kafka (if AMQP interop is broad).

---

### 7. **Operations**

* Running as a systemd service.
* Logs & metrics.
* Performance tuning.
* Error handling / retries.

---

### 8. **Development & Contributing**

* Source repo info.
* How to build locally.
* How to contribute (PRs, issues).
* License & community guidelines.

---

### 9. **FAQ / Troubleshooting**

* “Why not just use Postfix?”
* “Can it send outbound mail?” (probably no).
* Common config mistakes.
* Debugging tips.

---

That gives you a **clean progression**: *Intro → Quickstart → Install → Configure → Use → Operate → Contribute.*

👉 Next step I’d recommend:
We should write the **Getting Started** page — something short that shows a user how to run LSMTPD and see it actually working with AMQP in under 5 minutes.

Want me to draft that “Getting Started” page now?
